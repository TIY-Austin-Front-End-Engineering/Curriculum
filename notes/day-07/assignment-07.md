# Command Line Quiz

## Description

Create a programming quiz on the command line to test the skill of your fellow students.

## Explorer Mode

* Create a quiz for your fellow classmates to take. The quiz should ask at least 15 HTML, CSS and JavaScript related questions.
* For each of the questions your program should ask the question using `console.log()` and `prompt` the test taker for an answer.
* Keep track of the number of total answers that the test taker answers correctly.
* When the test taker has answered all of the questions, display the total number of questions that they answered correctly as well as the percentage that they got right.

##### What to Submit

A link to a repository with the following files:
* main.js

## Adventurer Mode
*Adventurer mode is optional if you have extra time and want to challenge yourself.*

* If a test taker gets an answer correct your test should immediately tell them that they were correct. If the test taker gets a question wrong it should tell them that they were wrong and tell them the correct answer.
* Your answers should be case insensitive. For example, if the answer to a particular question is div the test taker should be able to answer DIV or div or dIV and any of those answers should be counted as a correct answer.
* Try to time the test and inform the user how long they took to complete the test at the end.

## Epic Mode
*Epic mode is optional if you have extra time and want to challenge yourself.*

* Make your test adaptive. If a user gets a question correct, give them a harder question next time. If they get a question incorrect, give them an easier question next time instead.
* After the test taker is done taking the test, inform them where they need to improve their skills based on the types of questions that they got wrong. If they answered all of the CSS questions correctly, but the HTML questions only got 50% tell them to brush up on their HTML skills, etc.
