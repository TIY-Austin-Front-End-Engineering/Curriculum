# Basic Webpack Boilerplate

With the following features:

* Sass compiled to css in an external stylesheet
* ES2015
* React and ReactDOM
* An app directory for development and a dist folder for builds
* Static compilation of jpg and png images
* Nothing else

### To use this on a new project
* Clone the repo!
* Change the remote!
* Install the packages with `npm install`!
* To start the dev server run `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
  * Your project is now live at 'localhost:8080' and livereloaded on change at 'localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server'
* To build your assets into the `dist` directory run `webpack`
* **NEVER TOUCH THE CONTENTS OF THE DIST FOLDER**
* Build whatever you like in the app folder
