4. For each function write out with pen and paper the arguments that are getting passed into the function. For each argument write out...
  * the type of data (string, number, boolean, array, object) that it should be
  * one example valid value that could be passed in to that argument
5. For each function write out with pen and paper
  * in english: what should be returned from the function?

##### Notes

> You will need to run the npm install command to install all of the necessary dependencies for this project. When you run npm install the node package manager will look at the package.json file and install everything that is listed as a dependency or devDependency.

> You can test to see if the function is working as expected by running the command npm test. This will run through the unit tests and let you know if anything is failing a test. When you begin everything will be failing. As you complete the functions, the tests should start to pass.

> You can play the actual game by running the command node scripts/main.js.
