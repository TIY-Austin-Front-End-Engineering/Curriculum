# Graduation Requirements

For those of you who will not be graduating on November 13th, 2015 I've included all of the information you will need in the coming weeks to finish up your work at The Iron Yard. It's important to note that all of these are **requirements** for graduation. If you miss any of these, including the check-ins you will not graduate. Requirements include:

1. Completing the important homework assignments.
2. Checking in weekly, either via email or in person depending on the week.
3. Completing your final project.
4. Final assessment.

## My Availability

These check-ins are required, but are not the only times that I am available for help. You are welcome to slack me at any time (I'll respond when I can) or schedule a time for an in-person or skype one on one (preferred). I will be out of town from:

* 11/23/2015 through 12/14/2015
* 12/23/2015 through 01/02/2016

I will be harder to reach during these dates, but skype meetings are possible if you give me enough notice.

## Honor Code

I wish I didn't have to bring this up, but it has been an issue in the past. Your work must be your own. You may not copy and paste code from anywhere online, including from other students. You may of course use the internet for helping you solve problems, but all the code that you submit must be your own. Anywhere that you do find other code that helps you in completing these graduation requirements, you must attribute the source (stackoverflow, blog post, github, etc.) in the comments of your code. You must be able to explain each line of code that you write, including code that you find in other places.

## Homework Assignments


## Check-ins

It's your responsibility to make sure you send weekly email updates and show up for the one on ones until you graduate. I will *not* send reminders for these. You should coordinate with me to get a 30 minute slot reserved for the in-person one on ones. If you finish before 01/08/2016 you're welcome to demo and take the test early. Touch base with me if that's the case and we can schedule accordingly.

## Final Project
You will present your final project at on 01/04/2016. Below are the final project requirements.

1. [Final Project Planning](https://github.com/TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering/Final-Project-Planning) complete
2. Hosted live on GitHub pages or Heroku
3. Well designed
4. One of the following:
	1. Has at least three related data models that are stored to a server or...
	1. Has at least two data model that are stored to a server and uses one API that we didn't cover in class.
5. The project must be complete. It cannot accomplish half of something. You must be able to completely do what the app is designed to do, even if it's a simple - bare bones - version of what it is designed to do.

## Final Assessment

Since we won't be meeting as frequently after demo day, it's harder for me to get a grasp on where you stand in terms of catching up on your missed material. For that reason, the last graduation requirement is receiving a passing grade on a final assessment. This test will evaluate your grasp of the fundamental topics covered in the course. The questions will focus on the following topics, but may include some additional topics that we covered in the course:

* HTML
* CSS
* [Vanilla JavaScript and Jquery](https://github.com/TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering/vanilla-js-and-jquery-review)

The assessment will be administered on 01/08/2016 at 9am at The Iron Yard. You will be able to use a computer and the internet, but it's difficulty will take this into account.
